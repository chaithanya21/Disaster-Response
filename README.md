# Disaster-Response

This project is all about analysing disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

<h2>Description</h2>

The Project Dataset Contains real messages that were sent during the disaster events. The main aim of the project is to create a **machine Learning Pipeline** to categorize the events so that these messages will be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The Project also includes a **web application** where an emergency worker can input a new message and get the Classification results in several categories.The Web Application also displays visualizations of the data.
